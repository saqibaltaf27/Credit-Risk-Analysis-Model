Credit Risk Analysis Model
This project implements a Credit Risk Analysis Model using machine learning techniques to assess the risk of customers defaulting on credit obligations. 
The model leverages customer data, transaction history, and credit details sourced from SAP Business One to predict potential default risks.

Key Features:
Data Integration: Consolidates customer, item, and transaction data from SAP B1 into a unified dataset.
Feature Engineering: Develops features capturing historical payment behavior, credit exposure, stock details, and customer profiles.
Model Training: Utilizes algorithms like XGBoost for model training and evaluation.
API Deployment: Deploys the trained model as a RESTful API using FastAPI for real-time credit risk assessment.
Monitoring and Reporting: Implements monitoring tools to track model performance and detect prediction drifts.
This project is aimed at enhancing the decision-making process in credit management, providing insights into customer behavior and financial stability.
