Credit Risk Analysis Model
Overview
The Credit Risk Analysis Model implements machine learning techniques to evaluate the risk of customers defaulting on their credit obligations. By leveraging customer data, transaction history, and credit details sourced from SAP Business One, the model predicts potential default risks.
Key Features
•	Data Integration: Consolidates customer, item, and transaction data from SAP B1 into a unified dataset.
•	Feature Engineering: Develops features that capture:
o	Historical payment behavior
o	Credit exposure
o	Stock details
o	Customer profiles
•	Model Training: Utilizes advanced algorithms like XGBoost for effective model training and evaluation.
•	API Deployment: Deploys the trained model as a RESTful API using FastAPI, enabling real-time credit risk assessments.
•	Monitoring and Reporting: Implements tools to monitor model performance and detect prediction drifts, ensuring consistent accuracy.
Purpose
This project aims to enhance the decision-making process in credit management, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and financial stability.
